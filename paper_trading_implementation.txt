PAPER TRADING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

1. MODIFICATIONS NEEDED:

A. Position Class:
- Add is_paper: bool flag
- Update string representations to show (Paper) for simulated trades

B. TradingBot Class:
- Add paper_trading: bool flag (default True when trading_active is False)
- Add paper_balance: float (starting simulated USD)
- Add paper_positions: Dict[str, Position]
- Add paper_trade_history: List[Dict]
- Add paper_portfolio_value: float

C. Trading Logic:
- Modify _place_buy_order and _place_sell_order to:
  * Check if paper_trading is True
  * If yes, simulate the trade with paper balance
  * Include Coinbase fees in calculations (0.6% per trade)
  * Update paper positions and history
  * Don't make actual API calls

D. Portfolio Tracking:
- Update get_account_balance to include paper trades when paper_trading is True
- Modify get_position_info to show both real and paper positions
- Add (Paper) tag to all simulated positions in display

2. NEW METHODS NEEDED: 

def simulate_buy_order(self, symbol: str) -> None:
"""Simulate a buy order with paper trading"""

def simulate_sell_order(self, symbol: str) -> None:
"""Simulate a sell order with paper trading"""

def get_paper_balance(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
"""Get paper trading account balance"""

def reset_paper_trading(self, initial_balance: float = 1000.0) -> None:
"""Reset paper trading with new balance"""

3. COMMAND UPDATES:

A. Add new commands:
- !paper start    (Start paper trading with initial balance)
- !paper reset    (Reset paper trading)
- !paper balance  (Show paper trading balance)

B. Update existing commands to show paper trades:
- !positions      (Show both real and paper positions)
- !poshistory     (Show both real and paper history)
- !performance    (Include paper trading stats)
- !status         (Show paper trading status)

4. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

1. Update Position class
2. Add paper trading flags and storage
3. Implement simulation methods
4. Update portfolio tracking
5. Add new commands
6. Update display methods
7. Add paper trading reset functionality

5. CONSIDERATIONS:

- Accurate fee simulation (0.6% Coinbase fee)
- Slippage simulation (0.1-0.5% price difference)
- Realistic trade execution timing
- Clear distinction between real and paper trades
- Separate performance tracking
- Data persistence for paper trades
